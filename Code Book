## Details ##
The raw data comes from either one of two pieces of equipment: 1) accelerator or 2) gyroscope. The column name will detail how these measurements were originally seperated and analyzed (ex: the original data points were calculated into either a mean or a standard deviation, 
if the accelerator signal was a body or gravity signal etc). 
Since these data are grouped by unique combination of the "Activities" and "Subject", these current columns calculate the average of the original raw data calculations per unique grouping. Therefore, using "Time Body Acceleration-mean-x Axial Direction"  as an example,
this column takes the average of all of the original outputs that are in the same Activity/Subject grouping. 

## Units ##
time was originally captured at a constant 50 Hz
frequency was originally captured at 20 Hz for noise removal and again at 0.3 HZ for the acceleration's body and gravity signals
