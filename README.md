# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Homework-Week-4

This repo contains the following files:

1) run_anlysis.R
2) Tidy Data Submission.csv
3) Code Book
4) README.txt (this open document)

## run_analysis.R ##
This file contains the code that:
1) loads the files with the experiment's raw data and paramenters (as described in the original ReadMe provided in the Index below)
3) extracts the column names
4) filters the dataframe so that only the mean and standard deviation columns are kept
5) renames the dataset headers from generic column placeholders to the original descriptive names
6) merges the train and test datasets
7) renames the descriptive activities from numbers to character string
8) expands the column headers/variable names to expand on the abbreviations mentioned in the original code book
9) creates a new tidy data set that groups the dataset in step 7 by Activities and Subject, then calculates the mean for the rest of the columns
10) Exports the dataset in step 8 to a csv file for this repo

## Tidy Data Submission.csv ##
This file contains the output from the final analysis step in the run_analysis.R code. It provides one row per unique combination of Activities and Subject. Then it takes the average of the other columns within that grouping. This is saved as a csv file for easier future reload and analysis. 

## Code Book ## 
This document edits the original code book used to reflect the changes made during the analysis conducted in run_analysis.R. It only contains details about the relevant columns in my analysis's final tidy dataset.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
